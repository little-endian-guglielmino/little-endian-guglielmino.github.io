There are a lot of auctions applications, typically web based, but we wanted to do something innovative, exploiting the power of Telegram, a platform that we appreciate a lot.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>We developed this telegram bot as a platform to serve both users, willing to publish auctions than users that want to bid for items.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/astone-telegram-bot.png\" alt=\"Astone\"></p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://telegram.me/AstoneBot\">Astone</a> user can create an auction from Telegram itsef, is in place an approval process to avoid publishing contents that can infringe copyright or other rules.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/astone-auction.png\" alt=\"Astone Auction\"></p>\n<p>When an auction is approved, a start date and time is set. When auction starts, Astone creates an engagement experience, with the pressure given by the same experience a user can live going to a real auction.</p>\n<h2>Â The outcome</h2>\n<p>The outcome is a proof of concept that is used as starting point for a lot of custom projects. Occasionally the original bot is updated bringing to it some improvements.</p>\n<p>The original project is released as open source <a href=\"https://github.com/guglielmino/astone-bot\">here</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"July 17, 2018","title":"Astone, the Telegram auctions bot","description":"Astone, reltime auction platform for Telegram","tags":["Telegram","MongoDB","Node.js","Bot"]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"9f22503b-4166-5e5d-bcfd-b536663a3e80"}},"staticQueryHashes":["4080856488"]}
